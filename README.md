# Marketing Analytics Linear-Regression-Project
This project deals with predicting prices of used cars and what factors influence the most. Segment of family crossover vehicles was chosen. To keep it family oriented, data collection was limited to five-seater models in the mid-price range and intentionally excluded all luxury makes and models.
Data was taken from the data from cargurus.com focusing on predominantly on three specific models of varying years: the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape, and the Honda CR-V.
